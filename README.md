## Introduction
`Financial Freedom` is an open source alternative to Mint, YNAB, and more. With open source at its core, you have the freedom to review exactly what's happening with your data and participate in the improvement of the product.

Break free from third parties tracking every financial footstep you have. Run this application on any device or host that supports Docker -- if that's something like AWS, Digital Ocean, or even your own Raspberry Pi running in your basement.

> [!WARNING]  
> **This product is actively being developed.** This started as a fun side project that took off faster than we expected. We're currently revamping the product to make it easier for everyone to use and contribute.

**Here's what you can do right now:**
- **[Watch our progress](https://github.com/orgs/serversideup/projects/6/views/2)**: Watch us in realtime with GitHub projects.
- **[Join our Discord](https://serversideup.net/discord)**: We're actively discussing the product and how to make it better.
- **[Star us on GitHub](https://github.com/serversideup/financial-freedom/stargazers)**: Give us confidence that we're solving a problem that you care about.
- **[Follow Twitter](https://twitter.com/serversideup)**: We post frequent updates. Check our personal accounts too. ([Dan](https://twitter.com/danpastori) & [Jay](https://twitter.com/jaydrogers))
- **[Sponsor Us](https://github.com/sponsors/serversideup)**: We're a two person, bootstrapped team. Help us replace client projects with more time for open source projects.
