# Install on Synology
::lead-p
Financial Freedom can run on Synology DSM 7.2+ using Docker Compose. This guide will walk you through the steps to get Financial Freedom up and running on your Synology NAS.
::

## Prerequisites
- It is highly recommended that you upgrade to DSM 7.2+ before proceeding so you can utilize the [Container Manager](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/docker) package that ships with DSM 7.2+.

## Create a folder to store your Financial Freedom data
Open the File Station and create a new folder to store your Financial Freedom data. This folder will be mounted into the Financial Freedom container. It is recommended to put this on your fastest volume (SSD if available).

![Create a folder to store your Financial Freedom data](/images/docs/install-synology/create-folder.png)

## Prepare env file
Next, we need to create an `.env.conf` file to store our environment variables.

::note
We use the `.env.conf` extension to make it easier so you can manage the file in File Station.
::

1. Download the [`.env.example` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/financial-freedom/main/.env.example) from the Financial Freedom repository.
1. Upload the modified file to the Financial Freedom folder you created in the previous step.
1. Rename the file to `.env.conf` (remove the `.example` extension).
1. You can open the file with the [Text Editor package](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/packages/TextEditor) with Synology.
1. Be sure to set the `APP_KEY` value to a [proper Laravel key value](https://laravel-encryption-key-generator.vercel.app/)
1. Set your Database Passwords to [randomly generated values](https://randomkeygen.com/).

In summary, your folder structure should look like this once you are done:

::code-panel
---
label: Folder Structure of `/docker/financial-freedom`
---
```txt
.
└── .env.conf
```
::


## Install Container Manager
Open the Package Center and search for `Container Manager`. Click `Install` to install the package.

## Create a New Project
Open the Container Manager and click `Create` under `Projects` to create a new project.

![Create a New Project](/images/docs/install-synology/create-project.png)

Set the following values:
1. **Project name**: `financial-freedom`
2. **Path**: Select the folder you created in the first step.
3. **Source**: `Create docker-compose.yml`

You can use this template for the `docker-compose.yml` file:

::code-panel
---
label: docker-compose.yml
---
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:

  php:
    image: serversideup/financial-freedom:latest
    ports:
      - 8080:80
      - 8443:443
    env_file:
      - .env.conf
    volumes:
      - logs:/var/www/html/storage/logs
      - sessions:/var/www/html/storage/framework/sessions
    depends_on:
      - mariadb

  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:10.11
    volumes:
      - database:/var/lib/mysql
    env_file:
      - .env.conf

volumes:
  logs:
  sessions:

```

Press `Next` to continue and you do not have to enable the web portal via Web Station if Synology prompts you.

## Accessing Financial Freedom
Once the project is created, you can access Financial Freedom by going to `https://<your-synology-ip>:8443` in your browser.
